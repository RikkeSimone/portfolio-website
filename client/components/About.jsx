            <p>Welcome to not only my online portfolio, but also my wee online playground I continue to develop and 
              experiment with!</p>

             <p>My name is Rikke and I am a trained full stack web developer. Web development has been an interest 
              of mine for years, which finally pushed me to transition into tech this year, 
              turning my hobby into a full time career. 
            
            <p>Commended for being approachable and caring within a team environment, as well as being extremely 
              forward thinking and always developing new ideas, I aim towards providing solutions which benefit my clients
              and colleagues alike.
            </p> 
            
            <p>I am always seeking new challenges and interesting projects to work on within an agile team environment, 
              while offering a supportive and caring team member with a love for problem solving and a thirst for 
              continued development.</p>

            <p>Feel free to contact me with any queries you might have. Whether if you're an employer seeking 
              a long term web developer or a client who is in dire need of a website, I am here to help.</p>
